# Hadi's Data Analytics Portfolio

## 🚀 About Me
Hadi, a motivated Data Analyst by the belief that data can be used to make better decisions. I wants to be able to make it easier for people to understand code and use data efficiently. I believe in the power of data and impact it can create on human lives. I primarily use Python, but also has experience with PostgreSql and Excel. I have a Sciences background and hold a Bachlors of Science (B.S.) degree in Physics.

This is a repository that I have created to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics related topics.

## Technical Skills used

Python

Data Cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis

PostreSql for Analysis

Data Visualization to draw conclusions.
